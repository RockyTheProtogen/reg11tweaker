# reg11tweaker
This is a tool made to tweak the windows 11 registry. This may contain tweaks that are outdated or unstable.
Feel free to modify the script to better meet your needs.

This modifies your registry and downloads a start menu replacement. (The replacement is not my own and all credit can go to Hofknecht, who has made systemtraymenu.)
